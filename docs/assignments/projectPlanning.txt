Project Briefing

Goals and Impact

At a high level, PufferPhish aims to deliver a proactive, ML-powered phishing detection system that protects users before they become victims, unlike existing reactive solutions that depend on post-incident reporting. Our 16-week deliverable includes a fully functional Chrome extension, cloud-based detection API, and a web dashboard for users. 

Product Impact
	This project is important as it addresses one of the most prevalent and damaging cyber threats facing internet users, and existing solutions inherently leave a window of vulnerability for new attacks. Phishing can disproportionately affect elderly or non-technical users, who are often the target of phishing attacks. Furthermore, non-native English-speakers may not be well equipped to identify threats when using English-based infrastructure. In our design, we will keep these aforementioned users in mind by focusing on accessibility in our user interface, as well as an intuitive user experience. This can come in the form of clear, visual indicators: relying on conventions such as green checkmarks and red iconography for our threat analysis results. Finally, small businesses may not be able to afford or prioritize enterprise security solutions, leaving them vulnerable. PufferPhish is able to turn threats into educational opportunities by informing users why a webpage or URL is flagged, and provide clear feedback if a page is not trustworthy.

Product Overview
	After installing the extension and creating an account, users can expect PufferPhish to automatically start working in their browsers. When a user clicks on a link, it will be analyzed by PufferPhish, and a small visual indicator will let them know that the website is safe to use. If we detect a small possibility of the website being a threat, we will use a different, larger indicator as a warning. If our model confidently detects a threat, or the site appears on a blocklist, a full page interstitial will appear to warn users. In the latter two cases, information will be provided as to what about the URL or website triggered our threat response. Users will be able to view threat protection reports from the web dashboard, manage their account, their personal whitelists and blacklists, and preferences regarding extension interface behavior. 

Success Metrics
Detection accuracy: >90% true positive rate with <10% false positives
Response time: Reasonable amount of time for real-time URL analysis
Performance Impact: <50MB memory footprint

Short-Term Goals
Deploy working prototype 
Achieve target detection metrics based on testing with known phishing samples
Build educational framework that explains detection decisions to users

Initial Project Management Plan & Milestones









Literature and Technology Review

PufferPhish addresses the challenge of phishing attacks and insidious URLs that flood the Internet daily, which can lead to identity theft, fraud, data breaches, and many other cyber crimes. Through research and experience our team has found that such phishing URLs are commonplace when browsing or interacting with the web and can upset lives and companies; however, current solutions fall short in various areas, including user interfaces (UI)/user experience (UX) and detection methods. With this in mind, our team is driven to provide a solution that not only addresses phishing as a threat, but allows users to easily understand and interact with our services.

AAG Information Technology (IT) and Cybersecurity Services, a leading provider of IT/Cybersecurity consulting, brings to picture the impact of phishing attacks through insidious URLs, stating that “the use of stolen credentials is the most common cause of data breaches” and that the cost of these data breaches “is more than $4 million”. With phishing attacks leading to costs that have a lower bound in the millions, corporations’ need for phishing protection is abundantly clear. Larger attacks can cost 10 to 100 times more than this, but costs are not all that companies face. Client business relations rely heavily on trust, making breaches and cybersecurity practices a large component of modern day corporate images. AAG goes further to mention that “Google blocks around 100 million phishing emails daily.” This depicts the current state of threats on the web, especially since these are done on a known URL basis, meaning the true number of phishing emails is likely much higher. With such a prominent problem, it is clear that corporations face a large threat from phishing URLs. Furthermore, the personal effects on people who are acted on by phishing URLs have their lives turned upside down, with identity theft and fraud at the forefront of problems. Huttemann’s close friend recently underwent a phishing attack leading to both fraud and identity theft, and the emotional impact that this accrued is immense. The need for an all around solution for corporate and private use is clear, as these attacks continue to ravish those unfortunate enough to accidentally click a link.

Current implementations of antiphishing use resources that rely heavily on known threat actors and cross referencing to warn users of malicious sites. Google's Safe Browsing is an industry standard API that is used by most all other browser extensions. This works in the context of cross checking known threat actors, but falls short on detecting new threats. Services that utilize Safe Browsing or API’s like it (such as NordVPN or Microsoft SmartScreen) suffer from the same fate, as they are bottlenecked in detection by what these APIs cross reference. Furthermore, the UI/UX fall extremely short, especially for less tech savvy users. William Ward uses NordVPN and has described multiple UI frustrations that lack customizations for what is being detected and how this information is being depicted. Other browser extensions exist that state they are used for phishing detection, when in reality these extensions themselves contain malware or are suspicious in themselves. This calls for the need of an all encompassing solution that does more than just cross reference materials, but actually tries to learn and detect malicious links before they are known.

To bring this comprehensive solution to life, our architecture is built upon a modern, scalable, and secure technology stack. Each component is deliberately chosen to ensure performance, reliability, and a seamless user experience, from the browser extension that serves as the frontline defense to the powerful backend that drives our detection engine.

The core of our user-facing protection is a lightweight yet powerful browser extension. We are building it with Vanilla TypeScript and Webpack, avoiding heavy frameworks to ensure minimal performance impact on the user's browsing experience. By adhering to Google’s latest Manifest v3 architecture, we guarantee enhanced security, privacy, and future-proofing. The extension's logic is divided:
A Service Worker runs in the background, handling network requests, managing state, and communicating with our backend API without disrupting the user.
Content Scripts are injected into web pages to analyze links in real-time, flag suspicious elements, and display non-intrusive warnings directly on the page.
A clean Popup UI provides users with quick access to statistics, settings, and manual URL submission, ensuring control is always just a click away.
Continuing from the user-centric design mentioned earlier, our web dashboard serves as the central hub for user interaction. It is built as a modern single-page application using React and TypeScript. This choice allows us to create a highly interactive and responsive interface.
Hosting: The dashboard is deployed as a static site on Amazon S3 and distributed globally via CloudFront CDN, ensuring fast load times for users anywhere in the world.
State Management: We utilize React Query to intelligently manage server state, handle data fetching, and cache API responses, resulting in a fluid and snappy UX.
Styling and Visualization: The UI is crafted with Tailwind CSS, a utility-first framework that enables us to build a custom, professional design rapidly. User protection data is visualized through Recharts, providing clear and insightful graphs of threats blocked over time.

Our entire backend is built on a serverless architecture to achieve scalability and cost-efficiency. Using Node.js and TypeScript, we maintain a consistent language across our stack.
API Gateway and Lambda: Instead of traditional servers, we use Amazon API Gateway (HTTP), which offers high performance at a lower cost. All API endpoints are backed by AWS Lambda functions, allowing us to scale compute resources automatically and pay only for what we use.
Authentication and Security: We leverage AWS Cognito to handle user authentication, with a JWT authorizer on our API Gateway to protect every endpoint. This also provides built-in rate limiting to prevent abuse.

Our data persistence layer is designed for reliability and speed. We use a managed RDS PostgreSQL instance (t3.micro), which handles backups and maintenance for us.
Type-Safe Access: We interface with the database using Prisma, a modern ORM that provides full type safety between our database schema and our TypeScript code, drastically reducing runtime errors.
Performance: To minimize latency and redundant computations, results from external API lookups and ML inferences for specific URLs are cached for 24 hours. Database indexes are heavily optimized for our most common queries, such as domain and user lookups.

This is where PufferPhish truly innovates beyond simple blocklists. Our custom detection engine operates within a Lambda function with 3GB of memory, capable of loading our machine learning model from an S3 bucket to perform inference on suspicious URLs. This serverless approach to ML is highly scalable and cost-effective. Should the ML model fail or return a low-confidence score, we have a rule-based detection system as a fallback.
To augment our internal capabilities, we integrate with industry-leading threat intelligence APIs through a cached proxy Lambda. This proxy provides a single point of entry, centralizes our caching logic in PostgreSQL, and offers redundancy. Our primary sources include:
Google Safe Browsing
PhishTank
URLhaus
VirusTotal

By combining our custom ML model with these trusted external sources, PufferPhish provides a multi-layered defense that can detect both known threats and novel, zero-day phishing attacks.

Our Team consists of Gabriel Huttemann, William Ward, and James Choi. Gabriel Huttemann is the teams’ Security Engineer, with experience in penetration testing and defensive security. William Ward is the Infrastructure lead, having extensive experience in Full-stack development and infrastructure from his startup company Roots. James Choi is our ML Engineer, having taken classes in ML while studying at the University of Michigan, as well as deploying models for his own use.

PufferPhish came to light to address the issue of phishing attacks that arise on a daily basis on the web. Such attacks can have catastrophic effects on both companies and people, which beckons for a solution. By combining state of the art technologies, utilizing working methods, and expanding on new zero-day detection through machine learning, PufferPhish promises that browsing is the safest with it at one’s side. With a team of highly skilled and experienced developers, all reigning from a top university, one’s web safety can rest assured.
