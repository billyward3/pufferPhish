PROJECT BRIEFING

1. Goals and Impact of a Successful Project

High-Level Goals:
PufferPhish aims to deliver a proactive, ML-powered phishing detection system that protects users before they become victims, unlike existing reactive solutions that depend on post-incident reporting. Our 16-week deliverable includes a fully functional Chrome extension, cloud-based detection API, and user dashboard.

Success Metrics:
• Detection accuracy: >95% true positive rate with <2% false positives
• Response time: <200ms for real-time URL analysis
• User engagement: 80% of users interact with educational features
• Performance impact: <50MB memory footprint, <5% CPU usage

Strategic Benefits:
Our solution provides superior protection through proactive ML detection (vs. reactive blocklists), educational feedback (vs. silent blocking), and privacy-preserving architecture (vs. cloud-only analysis). This positions PufferPhish as a next-generation security tool that both protects and educates.

User Impact:
A successful project delivers immediate phishing protection to three underserved populations: senior citizens (simplified warnings in plain language), non-English speakers (visual indicators transcending language barriers), and small businesses (enterprise protection without IT expertise). Each user gains both immediate protection and long-term security awareness through our educational approach.

Long-term Goals:
Beyond the semester deliverable, PufferPhish can expand to email clients, mobile apps, and enterprise deployment, with potential to significantly reduce phishing impact across user populations.

Product Impact and Importance:

Why This Project Matters:
• Phishing remains one of the most prevalent and damaging cyber threats facing internet users
• Existing reactive solutions depend on user reports, leaving a window of vulnerability for new attacks
• Vulnerable populations (elderly, non-technical users) are disproportionately targeted and lack adequate protection
• Small businesses often cannot afford enterprise security solutions, leaving them exposed
• Educational opportunity: Most tools block threats without explaining why, missing chances to improve user awareness

Short-Term Goals (Semester Delivery):
• Deploy working prototype for beta testing with classmates and volunteers
• Achieve target detection metrics based on testing with known phishing samples
• Build educational framework that explains detection decisions to users
• Establish proof-of-concept for privacy-preserving ML detection
• Create foundation for potential open-source community contribution

Long-Term Vision (Post-Graduation):
• Release on Chrome Web Store for public adoption
• Partner with community organizations for digital literacy programs
• Develop affordable tier for small businesses
• Explore expansion to other platforms (email clients, mobile apps)
• Contribute to open-source security community
• Potential commercial development or acquisition opportunities

Societal Impact:
Our "not-only-you" focus addresses digital inequality, recognizing that vulnerable populations (seniors, non-English speakers, small businesses) often lack adequate phishing protection. By democratizing enterprise-grade protection with educational components, PufferPhish aims to reduce the security gap between technical and non-technical users.

2. Background Information

Similar Solutions & Techniques to Leverage:
• Google Safe Browsing: Industry-standard API we'll integrate for baseline protection
• PhishTank: Community database providing 500K+ labeled URLs for model training
• Microsoft SmartScreen: UI patterns for non-intrusive warning displays
• Netcraft Extension: Educational approach we'll expand with ML-powered explanations
• VirusTotal API: Multi-engine validation we'll use for reducing false positives

Technical Challenges Anticipated:
• Real-time ML inference: Achieving <200ms response requires optimized models and edge computing
• False positive minimization: Balancing security with usability to avoid warning fatigue
• Visual similarity detection: Implementing CNN-based brand impersonation detection efficiently
• Cross-browser compatibility: Manifest V3 migration and future-proofing
• Privacy preservation: Implementing on-device processing while maintaining cloud learning

Field Experts and Team Expertise:
• Academic Leaders: Dr. Ruoyu Wang (ASU) pioneered visual phishing detection; Dr. Adam Doupé (UCSB) leads URL-based ML detection research
• Industry Experts: Google Safe Browsing team (Elie Bursztein), Microsoft Security Research (Aanchal Malhotra)
• Team Expertise: Huttemann has ML research experience from REU program; Choi interned at AWS; Ward contributed to open-source browser extensions
• Advisory Resources: Prof. Honeyman (UMICH Security) available for consultation; AWS student support for architecture review

Specific Challenge Areas:
• Performance Bottleneck: Chrome's 6-second service worker limit requires optimizing model loading (challenge: 50MB model in <500ms)
• False Positive Balance: Enterprise tools achieve <1% FP rate; our target <2% requires extensive threshold tuning
• Visual Processing: Real-time screenshot analysis without UI blocking requires offloading to web workers
• API Rate Limits: Free tiers limit to 1000 requests/day; implementing intelligent caching and batching critical

Key Technical Hurdles:
The primary challenge is implementing ML inference that's both accurate and fast enough for real-time protection. We'll address this through model quantization, edge caching, and selective cloud processing for high-risk scenarios only.

3. Team Members, Skills, and Organization

Team Composition:
• James Choi (CS Major): Full-Stack Development, React expertise, AWS infrastructure
• Gabe Huttemann (CS Major): Machine Learning, Python, Security research background  
• William Ward (CS Major): Browser extension development, JavaScript/TypeScript, UI/UX

Organizational Structure:
We've adopted a parallel development model with clear ownership boundaries:
• Frontend Lead (Ward): Chrome extension and user-facing interfaces
• Backend Lead (Choi): API development, database, and cloud infrastructure
• ML Lead (Huttemann): Model selection, optimization, and inference pipeline

This structure enables concurrent development while minimizing blocking dependencies. Each lead owns their vertical slice from design through deployment.

Skills Gap Analysis:
• Required learning: Chrome Manifest V3 APIs, AWS Lambda optimization, Hugging Face deployment
• Mitigation: Allocated 2-week learning phase, leveraging documentation and tutorials
• External resources: AWS credits through GitHub Student Pack, Hugging Face community support

4. Project Management Strategy

Tools & Techniques:
• GitHub Projects: Kanban board for task tracking with automated PR integration
• Discord: Daily async standups and real-time problem-solving
• GitHub Actions: CI/CD pipeline with automatic testing and deployment
• AWS CloudWatch: Performance monitoring and cost tracking

Justification:
GitHub-centric workflow chosen for seamless code-task integration, version control, and industry-standard practices. Discord enables quick communication across different schedules.

Management Cadence:
• Daily: Async Discord standups (2min per person)
• Weekly: Friday integration testing and milestone review
• Bi-weekly: Scope adjustment based on velocity and blockers
• Monthly: Executive-style progress report

Team Experience:
All members have GitHub collaboration experience. Choi has prior project management experience from internship. Learning curve primarily around AWS services and Chrome extension APIs, addressed through dedicated learning sprint.
