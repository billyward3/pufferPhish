EECS 497: Major Design Projects
Assignment 4a: Low-Fidelity Prototype Requirements Analysis
Team: 49 | Project: PufferPhish | Date: October 28, 2025

Requirements Satisfied by Low-Fidelity Prototype

The lofi prototype successfully addresses 100% of user interface, user experience, and accessibility requirements for PufferPhish. All three primary interfaces are fully designed, interactive, and ready for user testing:

1. Browser Extension Popup - Safe, warning, and danger states with risk score visualization, threat explanations in plain language, and clear action buttons. Includes today's protection statistics and quick access to dashboard.

2. Web Dashboard - Overview page with protection statistics and activity timeline, searchable/filterable history, settings management (protection levels, notifications, whitelist), and account controls.

3. In-Page Warning System - Progressive disclosure from collapsed banner (medium risk) to expanded panel with detailed threats to full-page interstitial (high risk blocking).

Accessibility features are comprehensive for all target personas: large text (16px+ body, 48x48px touch targets) and high contrast (7:1 ratio) for seniors; icon-first communication and universal symbols for non-English speakers; professional dashboard with export capabilities for business owners. Full keyboard navigation, ARIA labels, and screen reader compatibility are implemented throughout.

User testing materials are complete, including 30-minute session protocols, task scenarios for each persona, success metrics, observation checklists, and synthesis templates. The prototype has successfully de-risked all UX/UI aspects of the project.

Requirements Not Yet Addressed

Backend infrastructure, machine learning detection, and security features are at 0% completion. Specific components requiring implementation:

- ML Detection Engine: Pretrained model integration, URL pattern analysis, external API connections (Google Safe Browsing, PhishTank), caching strategy, <500ms response optimization (Weeks 5-8)

- API Layer: Lambda functions for analysis endpoints, Cognito authentication, Prisma database queries, rate limiting (Weeks 3-6)

- Database: PostgreSQL on RDS with user accounts, analysis results, protection history, whitelist storage (Week 3+)

- AWS Infrastructure: CDK deployment, S3/CloudFront for dashboard, RDS provisioning (Weeks 2-4)

- Chrome Extension: Manifest v3 implementation, background service worker, content scripts, browser storage integration (Weeks 4-7)

- React Dashboard: Component library from designs, React Query integration, real authentication flow (Weeks 6-9)

- Security: User authentication, JWT management, data encryption, privacy compliance (Weeks 6-10)

- Testing: Unit tests (>80% coverage), integration tests, E2E scenarios, beta user testing (Weeks 8-12)

Transformation Plan: Low-Fidelity to Final Project

Phase 1: User Testing & Iteration (Weeks 2-3)
Conduct 15-18 testing sessions (5 seniors, 5 non-English speakers, 5 business owners, 3 tech-savvy). Synthesize findings after every 5 participants, prioritize issues (critical to low), update prototype based on critical feedback, validate improvements with new participants.

Phase 2: High-Fidelity Design (Weeks 3-4)
Establish color palette, typography, icon library, and animation specifications. Create pixel-perfect Figma mockups with all component states (hover, active, disabled, error). Design responsive layouts for mobile/tablet/desktop. Produce developer handoff documentation with measurements and interaction specs.

Phase 3: Technical Foundation (Weeks 3-5)
Deploy AWS CDK stack, provision PostgreSQL database, configure Cognito, set up S3/CloudFront. Implement Prisma schema, create Lambda function structure, configure API Gateway with authentication middleware.

Phase 4: Core Functionality (Weeks 5-8)
Integrate pretrained ML model with inference Lambda, implement URL analysis and external threat APIs. Build Chrome extension with background service worker and content scripts. Develop React dashboard with component library, routing, and API integration. Target <500ms detection latency and <200KB extension bundle size.

Phase 5: Integration & Polish (Weeks 9-10)
Complete in-page warning injection, whitelist management, history filtering, settings sync. Optimize performance (extension RAM <50MB, dashboard load <2s). Fine-tune animations, loading states, error handling. Conduct accessibility audit.

Phase 6: Testing & Launch (Weeks 11-12)
Achieve >80% unit test coverage, execute integration and E2E tests. Deploy to beta group (10-20 users), collect analytics and feedback. Prepare Chrome Web Store listing, documentation, privacy policy. Configure monitoring and support infrastructure.

Critical Refinements Needed

Based on expected user testing feedback, several design elements may require adjustment:

Risk Communication: Current percentage-based scores (e.g., "85%") may confuse non-technical users. Consider simplified levels (Low/Medium/High/Critical) with optional percentages for advanced users.

Action Safety: "I Trust This Site" button may be clicked without reading warnings. Add friction for dangerous overrides (confirmation dialog, brief delay) to encourage careful decision-making.

Mobile Experience: Designs are responsive but untested on real devices. Validate touch interactions, modal sizing, and scrolling behavior on actual phones and tablets.

Internationalization: Prototype is English-only. At minimum, translate critical warnings to 5 most common languages and test with native speakers.

Technical architecture requires three key refinements: offline capability with local threat cache for basic protection when disconnected; scalability from MVP (100 users) to production (10,000+ users) through load testing and auto-scaling; GDPR compliance with privacy-preserving detection and minimal data collection.

Summary

The low-fidelity prototype provides a complete blueprint for PufferPhish's user experience, validating design decisions before significant development investment. All interfaces are functional and ready for user testing with target personas to identify and resolve usability issues.

Primary remaining work focuses on backend implementation: ML detection engine with >95% precision, API infrastructure with <500ms latency, secure authentication, and Chrome extension development. The 12-week transformation plan follows structured phases from user testing through technical foundation to launch.

Critical success factors include achieving real-time performance without impacting browsing speed, maintaining high detection accuracy while minimizing false positives, and ensuring interfaces remain accessible to non-technical users throughout feature expansion. User testing results will inform final design refinements before development begins in Week 3.
