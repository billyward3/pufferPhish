# EECS 497:  Major Design Projects

## Project Planning Document

This assignment consists of three parts:

1. Project Briefing  
2. Initial Project Management Plan & Milestones  
3. Literature & Technology Review

### Assignment Background & Context

Regardless of the size of the organization, at times you will be expected to provide “skip-level” reporting. In “skip-level” reporting, you will communicate to managers and executives who will not be familiar with the details of your project. Your work is usually a very small part of the responsibilities of your audience. Therefore, it is important that you present your materials with this audience clearly in mind.

Communication should be short and direct; do not include unnecessary details. It is common for a senior engineering manager to evaluate 5-20+ reports from their various reporting groups at one time. Successful communication in this mode requires that you distill your information down to a very concise analysis.

This is a team assignment and every member of your team should review the document and provide edit suggestions before submitting.

### Project Briefing

Your project briefing should consist of the following elements:

1. **Goals and Impact of a Successful Project** – Provide a brief description of your project’s high level goals for delivery and the scope of this work. Demonstrate that you understand the context of your project within your target user’s environment and the impact of a successful project on your user.  Here are some things to consider:  
   1. How will you actually evaluate the success of your project? What will you measure?  
   2. Why is this project important? Are there short term and long term goals?  
   3. What overall strategic benefit will your project provide?  For example, compared to your competitors, will your project be easier to use, cheaper, faster, more intuitive, less obtrusive, more secure, etc…  
   4. What will a successful project deliver to your user(s)?  
   5. What population or group of people does this project affect?  
      * Recall that the overall goal of our “not-only-you” requirement is that it should force your team to think about users that are unlike themselves.  This will require that your team put together a diverse set of user requirements with the hope that it will make you better software developers.  In other words, you will rarely be creating software for users that are just like you in the future and it is very important that you understand what it's like to be "in someone else's shoes".  This will also help to address the issues that are discussed in the *Technically Wrong* lecture since many of the examples of toxic tech were rooted in implicit biases, incorrect assumptions, and a lack of diverse training data.  Examples of a not-only-you audience will thus vary based on your team's composition, backgrounds, etc...

      

2. **Background Information** – Here are some things to consider:  
   1. What similar solutions or applications (for all or part or your scope) have you identified? Are there solutions or techniques you believe you can leverage?  
   2. If your project requires new technology development, who are the experts in the field? Does anyone on your team have expertise in this field?  
   3. Where do you anticipate the challenges of this project to be?  
   4. Is there a particular technical hurdle you must manage?  
        
3. **Team Members, Skills, and Organization** – list student team members’ names, degrees/majors and key strengths they bring to the team. Indicate your organizational structure and any subteams you plan to utilize. Here are some things to consider:  
   1. Why have you chosen a particular organizational structure?  
   2. Are there any skills that you anticipate you will need, but are missing from your team?  
   3. What skills or knowledge have you identified that you need to learn?  
   4. How have you assigned responsibilities to members?  
        
4. **Project Management Strategy** – Describe the strategy, tools, and techniques your team will utilize to help manage your project to an on-time, successful conclusion. Here are some things to consider:  
   1. Specify the tools/techniques you intend to utilize for your project and justify why they are chosen (e.g., Slack, MS Project, GitHub, Trello, internal system, etc.).  
   2. Does your team have experience with these tools? Do you need to add this to your list of new things to learn?  
   3. How often will you adjust your expected timing/scope of the Milestones?  
   4. Does anyone on your team have experience with Project Management? Do you need to add this to your list of new materials to learn?

### Initial Project Management Plan & Milestones

Gantt charts are used both for detailed project task management as well as communication of high level project plans. Please ensure that all text is of a readable size.

*Note: you may be required to communicate the status and plans of your project via a Gantt chart at numerous times throughout the semester. It is worthwhile to establish a standard structure that can be easily amended. Software that is designed to help you manage the process is strongly suggested.  You can find a list of these tools [here](https://its.umich.edu/computing/computers-software/software-services/software-information/project-management).  You may also want to consider using a simple spreadsheet app for creating a Gantt chart.*

Include a 1 to 2 page, top-level Gantt Chart that encompasses your entire project plan from the start to the end of the semester.  In general, try to break up tasks into smaller sub-tasks such that you are able to assign tasks to individual team members and not the entire group as a whole. This will allow your team not only to plan better, but also help to identify parallel tasks, potential critical path issues, etc..  *At a minimum*, your High Level Gantt chart must contain your team’s phases of project work and strategic milestones (see below).

1. **Select Phases of Project Work** (include such things as working hours available, expected start date, expected end date, any sequencing requirements, etc...). Consider the following list to support your identification of phases that are most appropriate to your project (you should select at least 5 Phases…more is better).  
   1. Start Up/Organization/Team self-education  
   2. Scope, Deliverable and User Requirements  
   3. User Contextual Design  
   4. Solution Development  
   5. Subsystem Development/Completion  
   6. Systems Integration  
   7. Testing/Evaluation  
   8. Recommendations/Redesign  
   9. Wrap Up and Final Reporting  
        
2. **Strategic Milestones** – Include at least these 5 Milestones with a specific date. You may adapt titles to best fit your project and include any other milestones that will be important for your project.  
   1. User Requirements  
   2. Completion of Rough, Preliminary or Conceptual Solution  
   3. Completion of Minimum Requirement Deliverable  
   4. First Day of Testing/Evaluation of Minimum Requirement Deliverable  
   5. Project “Freeze” Date (the last day of development changes)

### Literature & Technology Review

Include a review of relevant background and supportive information related to your project. This should include a list of any internal knowledge and/or skills from your team members and a review of relevant, related solutions or applications from industry, competitors, etc. Focus on the technology (code libraries, APIs, etc) you will be using and/or any existing products that are similar to your project idea. If you include “competitor” products, be sure to explain how your product will be meaningfully different or how it will improve upon them. Depending on your specific project, you might also want to focus on the problem you are trying to solve. For instance, if your project is meant to be used by children, you should demonstrate some research into design principles of software geared towards children or the ways children interact with software. ***Finally, all sources should be cited in a List of References and/or Bibliography which you may format however you like (see Wikipedia for a good example of how to list references).***

The length of this section will be different for each team. Overall, we want to see that you have done sufficient research so that you are prepared to implement your project with minimal setbacks or time spent redesigning. In addition, your review should not simply be a regurgitation of the information you have discovered. A good review does not just summarize the literature, but discusses it critically. Your review should identify the most important concepts and previous work and then explain their relevance to your project solution. While most sources you study will enhance your understanding of the field, only the most important should be discussed within your review.
